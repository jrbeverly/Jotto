# Abstract

Jotto is a logic-oriented word game played with two players. Each player picks a secret word of five letters (that is in the dictionary), and the object of the game is to correctly guess the other player's word first. Players take turns guessing and giving the number of Jots, or the number of letters that are in both the guessed word and the secret word.
